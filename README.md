# Deep-learning-chat-bot
The goal is to make a chat bot, that notes down user replies and is able to hold a conversation based on previous user input.

Ideas:
 1. Create two files that the bot will draw data from. Files cannot be operated on when in use, so the plan is to write down responses in a document and swap between the two to avoid this problem.
 2. Create automatic persistence, this is so that the bot will seem more and more human as time runs on. If this bot has to keep resetting it will be more and more inconsistent as the amount of inputs will be reset.
 3. If the user has to input replies, the bot should also learn conversation starters so that interacting with the AI will be smoother.
